Production deployment
=====================

We provide documentation for two different ways of installing PANDA for production use. Non-advanced users and those who desire the simplest setup possible should install their PANDA on Amazon's EC2 service. This is the best-supported option.

Those who are concerned about the security of storing their data in the cloud or who have access to dedicated hardware may choose to install PANDA on their own server. Although we make every effort to support this, we can not offer any guarantee of compatibility.
